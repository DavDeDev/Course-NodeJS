When using Express, in most cases, is served to setup API or SSR.

API in Express and HTTP:
We setup an HTTP interface to interact with our data (in JSON form) --> RES.JSON()

SSR we render templates and send back entire HTML,CSS and JS file --> RES.RENDER()

For the most, the setups are similar 

APIs: Our server provides data in JSON format and our front-end can retrieve those datas with a simple HTTP - request
